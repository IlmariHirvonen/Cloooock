A simple Arduino based eurorack clock module. I may add some stuff in the future like encoder acceleration.

Current functionality:
* BPM adjustment 30-9999 bpm
* Pause and play
* Time division adjustment
  * Press encoder to enter channel selection
  * Press encoder to select channel
  * Select with encoder between 1/1 to 1/128
  * Press encoder to go back to channel selection or play/pause button to restart clock
